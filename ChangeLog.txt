* Change log
	* 0.15.1
		* You can call script-functions from within your C++ application by the VirtualMachine::callScriptFunction() method.
		* error() builtin function supported. It throws a runtime error message.
		* Major bug fixes.
		
	* 0.14
		* Arguments are not copied to a temporary buffer anymore. They are pushed onto the value-stack so no additional copy is required.
		* store.x ops replaced by push.x ops.
		* Built-in functions str() and join() added.
		* Strings can be defined with the syntax "^symbol" where symbol is a string containing identifier-like only characters.
		* You can define dictionaries in multiple lines now.
		* Internal rewritings/polishment.

	* 0.13
		* assertArgumentsCount() removed. Now you can define the number of accepted arguments when registering an new function so every function call is checked at compile time.
		* "continue" and "break" statements usable within loops.
		* compilation errors correctly provide the line number where the error is found.
		* if you create a new variable within a for or while condition/assignment expression, these variables are local to the loops now and are deleted after the loop is executed.
		* major internal improvements, restructuring and polishing.
		
	* 0.12
		* Better script test utility. It runs all scripts contained in the scripts folder.
		* Lexer def keyword bug fix.
		* Some polishment
		* assert() and dump() functions. assert() takes one or two arguments. The former one is the expression that will be tested and must be true. The latter one is a string that will be printed if assertion fails. dump() prints the current VM state debug information.
		
	* 0.11
		* Documentation added. Some polishing.
